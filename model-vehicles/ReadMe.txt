MODEL VEHICLE LIGHTS

These circuits are for 12V LEDs connected to model cars
and so forth.  

There is a 555 / CD4017BE combination that controls which lights are running
out of; left indicators, right indicators, nothing and break lights.
A 555 timer circuit generates the indicator signals.

The circuit is designed for an external switch to alternate the headlights
and lowbeams.
