VARIABLE BOOSTER

This circuit is for and booster with feedback. 
Using CMOS 555 and monolithic multivibrators a signal of 1.2mHz
is generated and fed to a switching inductor board.  The inductor 
board feeds back to the signal generating board, which uses an 
op-amp to compared the feedback signal and then control the 
switching and voltage supply level to the switching/inductor 
board.  This gives low power consumption & high voltage output.
delivers enough current to run a DC gearhead motor at about 30V
/ 400mA of a 12 volt supply.
