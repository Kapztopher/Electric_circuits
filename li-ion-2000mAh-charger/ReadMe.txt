LITHIUM ION CHARGER (1500mAh)

This circuit for a 3 port charger, capable of charging all 3 
batteries simultaneously.

Delivers 2 stage charging, dropping charger current towards 
end of charging cycle.  Works well.

LED's indicate charge, when no batteries are connected LED's shine
brightly, when discharged battery is connected LED's will switch off
depending on how discharged the battery is.  

After battery is charged the LED's will be bright again as bright
as if no battery was connected.

Charging current remains constant at .7C but then drops
towards end charging cycle and does so until no current 
is being delivered at all when charge level reaches
4.1V / 4.2V.   At this stage LED's will be fully lit.
